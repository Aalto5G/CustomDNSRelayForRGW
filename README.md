# Custom DNS relay module for use with Realm Gateway software

## Description

This is Python 3 DNS server/relay software for Linux which can be used to test
and facilitate load balancing with multiple Realm Gateway servers running simultaneously.

This current README-file and the current code here are not quite finished yet (even though
the program works). Finalized version of the code with added commentary and more
practical parameter input and expanded, more informative README will be added in the very
near future to this repository.
